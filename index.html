  <p class="p1">Let me tell you a little bit about myself. First things first, I have a much too large love for all kinds of art. Be it music, which resulted in my passion for singing, my learning to play piano, trumpet, french horn, guitar and ukulele, as well as a close and inseparable relationship to my iPod and CDs (yes, I still more often then not will be found with a portable CD player in hand.) But on rare occasion, when I’m not found with headphones over/in my ears, I have also taken part in acting in a select few musicals, and taken part in ballet and jazz classes for 8 years of my earlier life and a competitive rhythmic gymnastics team in the later 8 years. Finally, wrapping up with what I believe to be the largest part of my art addiction, is my love for illustration, photography, design, and painting.</p>
  <p class="p2">Art, however, is not my only joy in life. While most of my time is currently spent attending classes at Algonquin College in their Graphic Design program, I still manage to find time to maintain a job as an illustration and cartooning teacher for preschool and elementary kids. But when I do find the odd minute or two for myself, I quite enjoy taking part in activities such as rock climbing, surfing (when I’m not stuck back in Ottawa), or even just simply hanging out with family and friends, playing games, watching horror movies or binge watching shows on Netflix like Friends, That 70’s Show or Doctor Who (I’ll admit, I have my geeky sides.) Regardless, I hope you’ve learned a bit about me.</p>
